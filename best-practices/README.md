The guide below outlines recommended best practices to follow when using OpenTofu in Azure.

## Code

- Break down code into reusable modules for easier management, organization, and scalability. Promotes reusability and maintainability, reduces duplication, and makes code easier to understand.
- Writing with IaC to define your infrastructure ensures consistency, repeatability, and predictability in your deployments.
- Use variables and parameters to make your code more flexible and reusable. Helps to customize deployments, reduce duplication, and make code easier to maintain.
- Use Azure's Terraform providers ([AzureRM](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs), [AzureAD](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs), [AzureDevops](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs), [AzAPI](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs), [AzureStack](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurestack/latest/docs)) to interact with Azure's services and APIs, enabling seamless integration and management.

## Version control

- Use version control system like Git to track changes to code and collaborate with others. Helps to manage changes, track history of OpenTofu configurations, and collaborate effectively.

## Cloud provisioner

- Use a cloud provisioning and orchestration platform that provides features like remote state management, collaborative tools, deployment histories, user-friendly GUI, security & scalability. Helps to manage infrastructure as code, automate deployments, and collaborate effectively.

## Continuous integration

- Integrate OpenTofu with your CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment of infrastructure. Helps to ensure consistency, reliability, and repeatability in your deployments.

## Documentation

- Tag your resources to enhance visibility, organization, and management of resources. Helps to identify resources, track costs, and manage resources effectively.
- Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation to help others understand your OpenTofu configurations. Helps to onboard new team members, troubleshoot issues, and manage infrastructure effectively.

## Testing

- Include automated tests to validate your IaC, ensure correctness, and prevent errors. Helps to identify issues early, reduce risks, and improve reliability and consistency.

## Security

- Follow security best practices when writing OpenTofu code to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

## Monitoring

- Monitor your infrastructure to track performance, detect issues, and ensure availability. Helps to identify problems, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.
